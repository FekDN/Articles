## Progress in a Sandbox

### I. A Stairway to Nowhere: Why the Kardashev Scale is a Mirror of Our Infantilism

#### **Energy as a Metric for Primitives**

The very fact that we measure a civilization's progress by the amount of energy it consumes is a sign not just of an early stage of evolution, but of a planet-bound one. It's as if ants judged the development of their colonies by the number of leaves they carry. To them, this metric seems vital, but it becomes utterly meaningless the moment fundamentally different ways of existence are discovered.

We think in terms of "how many watts it takes to get to Alpha Centauri" because we still think linearly: more energy means more possibilities. This is the mindset of brute force, a relic of the industrial age, when we learned to burn coal and decided it was the pinnacle of development. We are still measuring ourselves by height and weight, even though the true metrics have long since moved to another plane.

This gives rise to the Kardashev paradox: the higher a civilization is on this scale, the less it needs it. A Type III civilization, truly in control of a galaxy, wouldn't waste 10³⁶ watts on solar sails or Dyson spheres. It would operate with information, manipulate the local laws of physics, or simply ascend to a different state of being. Energy would cease to be a limiting factor for it—just as muscle power ceased to be one for us when we invented machines.

Therefore, the popularity of the Kardashev scale is a mirror of our own immaturity. This isn't a mistake—it's a phase. Like a child's drawing: touching, sincere, but not a masterpiece. We are still children, playing with energy as if it were fire. True evolution will begin when the fire is no longer needed.

#### **The Fallacy of Efficiency: More Isn't Better**

The very idea that an advanced civilization would measure itself by its energy bill is a symptom of deep technological provincialism. It is the logic of the steam engine: more coal, more power. We still admire smoke and noise, mistaking them for signs of strength, when in reality they are signs of colossal waste and imperfection.

Our own progress is a story of minimizing, not inflating, costs. From vacuum tubes that devoured kilowatts to microchips that run on milliwatts. From the incandescent bulb that turned 95% of its energy into useless heat to the LED. Every step forward is not an increase in consumption, but a growth in efficiency per unit of useful action. We become "smarter" not when we build a bigger power plant, but when we achieve the same result while consuming a thousand times less.

To extrapolate this logic to the cosmos is absurd. Why would a civilization that has mastered matter at the atomic level burn an entire star to move an object or process information? It's like using a nuclear blast to boil a kettle. This isn't power; it's grotesque inefficiency.

The Kardashev scale ignores a fundamental law in the development of any complex system: progress is optimization. A focus on gross consumption is an admission of our own inability to invent anything more elegant than brute force. It mistakes the size of the furnace for the sharpness of the mind. In the universe, true power is silent. Noise is for primitives.

#### **The Real Metrics: Information, Evolution, and Death**

The true scales of progress are not calibrated in joules. They measure things far more fundamental than banal consumption. Judging a civilization by its energy usage is like judging intelligence by brain weight. Crude, primitive, and meaningless.

The first real metric is **information**. Not the volume of stored data, not the terabytes of junk on servers, but the density and complexity of information flows. The ability not just to accumulate, but to synthesize knowledge into a single, collective thought process. A civilization that created a global network for sharing pictures of food is on the same level as an amoeba that has learned to transmit chemical signals.

The second metric is **evolution**. More precisely, the transition from passive Darwinian selection to directed, artificial design. This is the moment a species ceases to be a slave to its DNA and becomes its master. As long as we dither, arguing about the ethics of gene editing, we remain biological raw material, a product of random mutations. The evolution of a snail versus the evolution of a thought.

The third metric is **death**. For primitive biology, death is a crude mechanism for renewal, preventing stagnation. For a developed civilization, it is a shameful bug that is long overdue for a patch. The ability to switch this process off is not just a technological trick, but a fundamental transition. It is an acknowledgment that the civilization has found more elegant ways to combat stagnation than the banal destruction of the bearers of old ideas.

And finally, the pinnacle: **the control of matter and the laws of the universe**. Why burn a star when you can program matter at the atomic level, assembling anything you want from it? Why travel somewhere at the speed of light when you can gain access to reality's source code and locally alter its properties—gravity, entropy, time itself? This is a transition from the role of a user to that of an administrator. We are still observers, trying to figure out the rules of the game.

### II. The Myth of the Singularity, or Why We're Always on a Threshold We'll Never Cross

#### **A History of 'Final Breakthroughs' That Went Nowhere**

Humanity suffers from a chronic form of megalomania, which flares up with every technological leap. We are a civilization of the perpetual "almost." Every generation is convinced that it is the one standing on the threshold of the final transformation, that its particular invention will be the lever that moves the world. And every time, this lever turns out to be just another toy in our sandbox.

Fire? "Now we are gods!" decided the apes who learned to cook meat. It turned out to be just a convenient way to avoid dying of cold and dysentery.

Writing? "Knowledge will become eternal!" thought the priests as they etched their hieroglyphs. The result: bureaucracy, tax ledgers, and compilations of boring laws.

The steam engine? "Man has conquered nature!" cried the 19th-century engineers. The result: filthy cities, child labor in factories, and the accelerated production of cheap consumer goods.

The internet? "A global mind!" proclaimed the visionaries of the nineties. And what did we get? Social media, targeted advertising, and endless arguments with anonymous commenters. Not a global mind, but a global bazaar.

And now, a new idol takes the stage: artificial intelligence. "Superintelligence in 5 years! Immortality! The solution to all problems!" scream the headlines. We are on the threshold once again, convinced that this time will be different. But history is a cruel teacher. Every time, we mistake a new tool for a new reality. Every time, we confuse acceleration with achieving orbit.

The Singularity is not a point in the future. It is the boundary of our imagination, which we, out of hubris, call infinity. We simply cannot see that beyond the next hill lies an even more complex and inhospitable desert. And we will trudge across it once again, proud of how far we've come from the last encampment.

#### **Complexity Grows Singularly; Progress Does Not**

We delude ourselves with the illusion of smooth, exponential growth because it's convenient. We look at a graph of technological development and see a curve soaring to the sky. But we don't see the cost of each subsequent millimeter on that graph. And the price is not just growing exponentially—it's growing singularly. Each next stage requires not just more resources, but a fundamentally new level of reality's organization.

From stone to fire required one person and one idea.
From a city to a state required thousands of people, language, laws, and a shared mythology.
From machines to factories required millions of people, science, capital, and global supply chains.
From artificial intelligence to the next stage... this level requires all of humanity, the entire planetary infrastructure, plus AI itself as a partner.

This is not a smooth curve. It is a hyper-exponent with discontinuities. Each transition is not just a quantitative leap but a qualitative, ontological shift. We cannot imagine the next stage not because it is "infinite," but because our brains, which evolved for survival on the savanna, are incapable of processing that level of complexity.

It is as if a Neanderthal tried to imagine the internet. To him, it would be magic, not technology. In the same way, to us, the next stage is the "Singularity." We use this name not for an explosion of progress, but for the boundary of our own perception.

We mistake the acceleration of information processing for real advancement. We are flying faster and faster, failing to notice that we are heading straight for a wall. Progress does not explode. It slams into a wall of complexity that it itself has built. And each time, breaking through that wall requires an effort incomparable to all that came before.

#### **We Aren't Awaiting a Leap; We Are Rebuilding the Platform**

The common belief that we are either stuck or one step away from explosive growth is a perceptual error. We are not standing still. We are engaged in the slow, dirty work of completely rebuilding the fundamental infrastructure upon which the next civilization will run. We are mistaking the process of installing the equipment for its launch.

Here is what our "breakthroughs" actually represent:

| Technology | Our Perception (The Goal) | Its Real Function (The Tool) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Artificial Intelligence** | Creating a superintelligence | Building the base infrastructure for processing information beyond biological capacity |
| **CRISPR, Gene Engineering** | Immortality and curing diseases | Converting biology from "hardware" into programmable "software" |
| **Internet, Global Data** | Communication and entertainment | Creating a global nervous system for a future planetary computational structure |
| **Space Launches (SpaceX)** | Colonizing other planets | Offshoring production capacity and creating backups beyond the main "server" (Earth) |

We are not "awaiting the Singularity." We are the construction crew pouring concrete and laying cables for a building whose blueprints we haven't even been shown. Our current work is not the leap itself, but the creation of the physical and informational conditions under which it might, one day, become technically feasible.

We will not see the final result for the same reason that the workers who mined ore in the 19th century did not see a modern microprocessor. They merely supplied the raw material. In the same way, we today are merely creating the raw infrastructure—neural networks, genetic editors, and data channels. We are not the users of the future system; we are its low-level components.

### III. Our True Level of 'Conquest'

The myth of human dominion is the most convenient self-deception we have invented to avoid feeling like ants on a rock. We are not conquerors. We are a thin, restless biofilm on the surface of a planet, mistaking our own scuttling for dominance. The reality is far more prosaic and ugly.

#### **Illusion #1: Space. A Garage Cluttered with Junk**
We call ourselves a "spacefaring civilization" because we have learned to throw our garbage a little higher than usual. Our "space program" is a costly ritual of polluting low-Earth orbit with tens of thousands of pieces of debris. This is not conquest; it is planetary-scale vandalism. Our forays to other planets? Sending a few remote-controlled toys that break after a couple of years, and taking pride in blurry pictures of rocks. We haven't entered space. We have merely cracked open the door, tossed some trash in the entryway, and cowardly slammed it shut.

#### **Illusion #2: The Planet. Scuttling on the Surface and Exporting Waste**
Our "mastery" of the planet is a farce. We exist in the thinnest layer between the Earth's crust and atmosphere. 95% of the ocean is an unknown and hostile environment to us, one we have visited less frequently than the Moon. The Earth's interior is a mystery sealed seven times over. Antarctica is a blank spot we are afraid to touch. Our "green economy" and "fight for cleanliness" are an even more cynical lie. We are not solving the waste problem; we are **exporting** it. "Clean" European countries pay to have their waste rot somewhere in Africa or Asia. This is not planetary management; it is parasitism, followed by sweeping the evidence under someone else's rug.

#### **Illusion #3: Globalization. Palaces with Wi-Fi Surrounded by a Disconnected World**
The myth of the "global village" and "universal connectivity" is designed for those who have never left the village. The majority of humanity lives without stable internet, and often without electricity. Advanced medicine is a local privilege for 20% of the population, not a global achievement. Our "globalization" is a few interconnected palaces with high-speed Wi-Fi, surrounded by a vast, disconnected world. This is not a unified civilization. It is a system of information enclaves for the chosen few. The rest are, at best, extras, whose existence is remembered only when cheap resources or labor are needed.

### IV. The Great Brake and the Inevitable Schism: How Stagnation Breeds a New Species

#### **The Fear of Elites and the Comfort of the Masses: Who and What Stops Us from Hatching**

Progress is not halted by comic book villains, but by perfectly rational and predictable forces. The first is the fear of the elites, who are terrified of losing what they have. Any fundamental breakthrough—be it strong AI, genetic engineering, or new energy sources—threatens to topple the existing hierarchy. It devalues their capital, their power, and their status. Therefore, their strategy is simple and effective: slow down, regulate, prohibit, and acquire. They strangle progress not out of malice, but out of an instinct for self-preservation.

| Group | What They Fear | Methods of Braking |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial Elites** | Devaluation of assets | Lobbying for laws, acquiring startups to shut them down |
| **Political Powers**| Loss of control over the populace | Prohibitive regulations, creating media panic |
| **Corporations** | Loss of monopoly | Patent trolling, standards wars, discrediting competitors |

The second force is the comfort of the masses. The majority does not crave great achievements and distant stars. It craves stability, predictability, and the next smartphone update. Any serious change is perceived as a threat to this comfort: robots will take jobs, genetics will create monsters, and space is just an expensive and useless toy. The masses do not sabotage progress actively; they do it passively, through their consumer choices and political apathy, supporting those who promise to keep things as they are.

These two forces—the fear of the top and the inertia of the bottom—create the perfect environment for stagnation. Progress doesn't stop completely; it is channeled into a safe, commercially viable stream—the production of gadgets and entertainment. This is the Great Brake.

#### **Homo Manens versus Homo Transiens: The Proto-Schism Already Underway**

The schism of humanity is not a future hypothesis. It is a slow-burning process happening right now, disguised as social and economic inequality. It is dividing us not into nations or classes, but into two emerging subspecies with fundamentally different purposes for existing.

***Homo Manens*** **(Man Remaining)** is the overwhelming majority. Their primary value is stability and comfort. Their developmental horizon is limited to the next smartphone model and the quality of entertainment content. They are the consumers of the existing reality, not its architects. Their evolution has stalled.

***Homo Transiens*** **(Man Transitioning)** is a microscopic minority. They are not interested in better gadgets; they are interested in rewriting the source code of reality. Their fields of activity are genetic engineering, neural interfaces, applied AI, and fundamental physics. They already exist in a different paradigm, preparing the platform for an exit from biology itself.

This proto-schism is visible to the naked eye, if you stop looking at GDP and start looking at vectors of development:

| Parameter | Homo Manens (The Remaining) | Homo Transiens (The Transitioning) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medicine** | Curing diseases | Editing biology |
| **Information**| Consuming content | Creating systems |
| **Goal** | Comfort and predictability | Transcendence |
| **Technology** | A tool for entertainment | A tool for transformation |

The gap between them is no longer quantitative, but qualitative. It is not the difference between rich and poor, but between the user of an operating system and its developer.

The best illustration of the *Homo Manens* mentality is their attitude toward uncontacted tribes. Under the noble pretext of "preserving a unique culture," the technologically advanced world deliberately leaves these groups in the Stone Age. In reality, this is not humanism. It is the creation of a living human zoo, whose exhibits flatter the ego of the observers, allowing them to feel "enlightened" and "responsible." This is the behavioral model of the dominant majority: not to develop and integrate, but to preserve and control. They will treat *Homo Transiens* in exactly the same way once they realize how far ahead they have surged.

#### **The 50-Camera Smartphone as a Symbol of the Schism**

A smartphone with fifty cameras is not a technological breakthrough. It is a monument to stagnation, the perfect symbol of the values of *Homo Manens*. The entire intellectual might of a civilization, all of its resources, are directed toward a microscopic improvement of a tool for self-admiration and content consumption. This is the schism in its material form: while *Homo Transiens* are in clandestine labs trying to crack the code of reality, *Homo Manens* are standing in line for a gadget that will let them take a slightly sharper picture of their dinner.

This meaningless race is just a specific instance of our general passion for grandiose titles and self-aggrandizement. We love to give our humble creations bombastic names to feel important. It's a cheap psychological trick, masking the absence of real, fundamental progress.

-   **"We have conquered the atom!"** we proudly declare. What does this actually mean? We have learned to build primitive steam boilers that run on the uncontrolled decay of elements we scrape out of the ground. We do not control the atom. We simply found a very hot and dangerous rock and are using it to heat water. This is not conquest; this is the level of a caveman who found a burning branch after a lightning strike.

-   **"We have conquered the sky!"**—another myth. We have learned to burn colossal amounts of fuel to crawl slowly and inefficiently through a thin layer of atmosphere at laughable altitudes. We are completely dependent on weather, fuel, and fragile machinery. This is not conquest, but the rental of a tiny air corridor at an exorbitant price.

-   **"4D Movies!"**—the pinnacle of marketing cynicism. We still cannot create a truly three-dimensional image without the crutch of glasses. What we call "3D" is pathetic pseudo-stereoscopy. And "4D" is just the addition of cheap tricks like splashing water in your face and shaking your seat. We have not gotten closer to a fourth dimension; we have just added another illusion to the illusion.

The 50-camera smartphone, named the "Pro Mega Max Ultra Hyper Vision," is the perfect continuation of this tradition. It is not a tool for development. It is a civilizational pacifier, created to keep the masses happy, busy, and not asking too many questions while the schism between them and those doing real work becomes insurmountable.

### V. A War of Species: Why the 'Remainers' Will Never Let the 'Transitioners' Go

The idea of a peaceful divergence of two human branches is a naive utopia. *Homo Manens* will never allow *Homo Transiens* to peacefully pull away. Historical precedent and basic human psychology guarantee a conflict, one that will be brutal and irrational. It will be triggered not by the aggression of the "transitioners," but by the very fact of their existence.

#### **Envy, Fear, and Greed as the Engines of Conflict**
The technologies of the "transitioners"—be it radical life extension, intelligence enhancement, or merging with AI—will become the primary irritant for the "remainers." The first reaction will not be admiration, but black envy. "Why do they have it and we don't?" This envy will quickly escalate into greed: "They are obligated to share! Their achievements belong to all of humanity!" And when it becomes clear that these technologies require a fundamentally different level of thought and organization, greed will give way to fear. The fear of their own inferiority, the fear of being left on the roadside of history, the fear of becoming a relic. This is an existential terror that cannot be silenced by a new smartphone.

#### **"Inhumane Experiments" and Other Noble Pretexts for Attack**
Direct aggression based on envy looks ugly. Therefore, a noble pretext will always be found for it. *Homo Manens*, led by their elites, will launch a massive propaganda campaign. The "transitioners" will be accused of every mortal sin:
-   **"Their experiments are inhumane and dangerous!"** (The classic argument against everything new, from vaccination to nuclear physics).
-   **"They are destroying nature and the planet!"** (An ideal manipulation, especially against the backdrop of real environmental problems created by the "remainers" themselves).
-   **"They want to enslave humanity!"** (A projection of their own fears and desires).
-   **"They have lost their humanity!"** (An accusation meant to justify their dehumanization and subsequent destruction).

These slogans will become the moral fuel for war. The masses, frightened and envious, will gladly support any crusade against the "mutants" and "monsters."

#### **The Inevitability of a Preemptive Strike**
Conflict will be inevitable because the elites of *Homo Manens* understand that time is working against them. The longer the "transitioners" develop in isolation, the wider the technological gap becomes. At some point, it will become insurmountable, and the "remainers" will lose all ability to influence the situation. Therefore, the strike will be preemptive, while the "transitioners" are still vulnerable. The goal will not be simply to capture their technology. The goal will be to destroy the very possibility of an alternative path of development. This will not be a war for resources, but for the right to define the future.
