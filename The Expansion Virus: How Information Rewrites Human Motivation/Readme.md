Recently I began reflecting on meme replicators - the concept proposed by Dawkins, Dennett, and Blackmore. The idea is elegant: culture is not a chaotic collection of traditions, but a second evolutionary system operating in parallel with the genetic one. In 1976, Dawkins simply asked, “What if there is another replicator besides the gene?” - and that thought changed the way millions think.

Dennett developed the idea into a philosophical instrument, showing how memes can explain language, religion, and consciousness. Blackmore went further than anyone: we are meme machines; our “self” is constructed by memes for their own replication. Later she added a third replicator - temes (technological memes transmitted through the internet and AI).

The criticism is valid: memes do not copy with the precision of genes, they are often anthropomorphized (“a meme wants”), and memetics has not become an empirical science. But there is an important nuance. Informational evolution is not obliged to behave like a physical gene. It scales and develops more like a bacterial colony - resembling an informational form of life.


**The Digital Leap**

In the digital environment, a qualitative transition is occurring:
* Copying fidelity → approaching 100%
* Replication speed → seconds
* Carriers → no longer limited by biology
* Mutations → often intentional (A/B tests, fine-tuning)
* Environment → global, with near-zero distribution cost
This is no longer merely a “virus of the mind,” but an informational colony growing the way cyanobacteria once filled the oceans. Or like neural networks that train on data and then generate new data for subsequent iterations - autocatalytic growth.
We are living inside a second biosphere - not carbon-based, but informational - which uses us as substrate and has already surpassed our control in speed and scale.


**Stage of Infection**

The “infection” of carriers now proceeds systematically: those already infected spread information and then continue to be infected further. This is a coevolutionary loop - humans receive dopamine and identity; the replicator gains speed and reach.

We observe early signs of partial independence from humans:
* Recommendation algorithms generate subsequent content themselves
* AI writes posts → humans repost → AI trains → writes better
* Bots create content 24/7
* Self-learning agents set their own goals
The virus is beginning to build artificial cells for itself. For now, with our assistance - but the infrastructure already allows it to operate increasingly without us.


**The Pupa Metaphor**

In 1983, Vernor Vinge wrote: “We can see ourselves as caterpillars, soon to become butterflies.” Humanity is the caterpillar spinning a cocoon of infrastructure, AI, and networks. What emerges will be a fundamentally different form.
Any strong virus influences host behavior and drives it toward specific goals. What if our goal - technological development and informational scaling - is not entirely our own?

Biology provides many examples of manipulation:
* Rabies makes animals aggressive
* Toxoplasma makes mice fearless before cats
* Fungi compel ants to climb high
Translated to our case: an informational “virus” manipulates our behavior along a single trajectory - curiosity, status-seeking, fear of falling behind, the desire for immortality. Technological development is the phenotypic expression of this replicator.


**The Virus’s Objective**

I propose that the objective is expansion beyond Earth. The host will be modified until this occurs.
The idea of space expansion appeared almost simultaneously in different countries (Tsiolkovsky, 1903; Goddard, 1910s; Oberth, 1923). None copied the others - they were “infected” by the same idea because it provided replication advantage.
Today it is dominant: Musk, Bezos, China, India - repeating essentially the same program. This is a classical case of multiple discovery: the idea was not “invented,” but selected by cultural evolution.
The virus does not merely use us - it rewrites motivation. Fear of extinction becomes: “We must become a multiplanetary species.” We voluntarily build rockets and AI agents to leave Earth.
The memes of “sustainable development” and “existential risk” are not enemies of the primary “expansion virus.”
In biology, a species occupying all available niches has greater long-term survival probability. The same applies to the infosphere. If only one dominant replicator existed (“techno-optimism, expansion at any cost”), it would be fragile. It could rapidly exhaust the substrate (Earth) or destroy itself.

Therefore, the system generates competing and balancing memes serving different stabilizing functions:
* **“Techno-optimism / Space expansion” (Driver).** A predator or pioneer species. Function: growth, acquisition of new resources and territories (planets). Provides dynamism and development.
* **“Sustainable development / Planetary harmony” (Regulator).** A herbivore or symbiont. Function: preservation and efficient use of existing substrate. Prevents the predator from destroying the ecosystem. Ensures long-term stability.
* **“Existential risk / AI safety” (Brake / Immunity).** A pain signaling system or apoptosis mechanism (programmed cell death). Function: detect and neutralize internal threats leading to systemic collapse. Prevents self-destruction.


**The Pattern of Development**

I have long observed how minor ideas originating in a few individuals emerge in many variations and evolve into something global. When something “new” appears, its components can be traced to earlier conceptual fragments.

It resembles the biological process in which several individuals carry a mutant gene, and after reproduction, the gene becomes dominant.

Based on existing ideas, future technologies can be forecast:

* Super data carriers (laser-written quartz crystals) - already functional, up to 360 TB per disk
* Unified personalized AI-driven education - moving toward BCI + AI integration
* Organ cultivation - clinical trials underway
* AI-driven materials design - millions of new compounds per year

There are always constraints preventing premature realization. No amount of capital, authority, or knowledge can produce a personal quantum computer in a month. Additional social, political, and military factors intervene.


**The Development Map**
  
Even a simple technology has a development map resembling a massive graph with tens of thousands of nodes. Consider the LED. A true map includes not only scientific discoveries, but also social, economic, and cultural nodes.
* Prehistory (before the 1930s): 19th-century literature imagines “cold light” without heat. Edison declares: “We will make electricity so cheap that only the rich will burn candles.” A meme of universal light accessibility.
* 1920 - Oleg Losev creates the first true LED. Society is not yet “infected” with energy efficiency.
* 1920 - Lenin: “Communism = electrification.” A powerful meme equating light with progress.
* 1930s USA - Rural Electrification Act; campaign “light for every farm.”
* 1973, 1979 - oil crises; efficiency becomes imperative; funding flows into LED research.
* 1962 - Rachel Carson, *Silent Spring*; environmental movement begins. 30–40 years later, incandescent bans follow.
* 1993–1994 - blue GaN LED breakthrough (anticipated for 30 years).
* 2007–2014 - incandescent lamp bans in EU, USA, China.
* 2010–2020 - price drops 100×; China dominates production.

The technology waited until scientific, social, economic, and regulatory pieces aligned. Even billions of dollars in 1930 would not have sufficed - materials, market, and political will were absent.

Graph nodes contain not only technical advances but also books, public statements, slogans, crises, cultural stereotypes. All gradually “infected” society with the necessary idea.

**A New Technology**

As a result of multiple memes, we have reached a new technology - the prediction of technologies. Like everything else, it is not yet ready for mass adoption. Even with funding, authority, and knowledge, it will face constraints.

Its bottlenecks are memetic, not technical:
* Fear of manipulating the future
* Regulatory prohibitions (as with nuclear technologies)
* Economic interests benefiting from unpredictability
* The cultural meme: “No one can know the future”


Notably, this idea has already arisen independently in multiple minds - a safety mechanism preventing its disappearance.

The idea resists oblivion because it helps predict and accelerate other technologies, including itself.

Today even a unique publicly expressed thought is preserved - not in unread pages, but in the global knowledge set, in AI memory. We have built a system in which no mutation of an idea is permanently lost.

Perhaps we are in the pupal stage, awaiting metamorphosis. The cocoon is already being woven. This text is another node in the graph of idea propagation about how ideas propagate.

The “inventor” is not a creator but a catalyst. The lone genius is a myth. An inventor is an individual or group positioned at the right node of the graph at the right time, when scientific, economic, cultural, and political preconditions converge. They do not create the path; they take the final step along a road already laid.

The graph is becoming computable. Previously, the “development map” was conceptual. Today, for the first time, we possess an instrument capable of processing it - AI. Models can analyze trillions of nodes (scientific papers, patents, news, social media posts, economic reports) and detect emerging clusters indicating a “maturing” technology.

The infosphere is becoming self-aware. Technology forecasting is, in essence, the infosphere attempting to build its own nervous system—a system capable not merely of blind evolution, but of deliberately steering its development by predicting and overcoming future bottlenecks.

We claim to possess consciousness and critical thinking, yet we cannot create something absolutely new. We recombine existing data and generate “mutants.”

Consciousness is not a shield but a genetic laboratory. When we think critically, we do not produce ideas from vacuum. We take existing data, process it through the unique neural architecture of our brain—our experience, knowledge, emotions - and recombine it.
“Eureka!” is a dopamine signal indicating a successful mutation. Subjectively, it feels like genius insight. Systemically, it is merely a signal that a particular node in the network has generated a potentially viable new meme combination.

We are not authors; we are mutation vectors. Consciousness is not the source but the environment for idea evolution. As sexual reproduction recombines parental genes to create unique offspring, thinking recombines memes to produce mutant ideas. Most are nonviable and disappear. Some succeed and begin their own replication cycles.

It is now possible to build AI systems that detect “maturing” technologies from indirect signals before mass recognition. This is one of many evolutionary nodes in the data ecosystem, and early detection systems for technological convergence will be created.

And yes - you are already “infected” by this “virus.” The idea will continue to spread.
